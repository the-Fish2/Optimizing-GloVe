# Optimizing Glove

Instead of 300 dimensions, this code simplifies them to 33 and proves that 33 is the best possible dimension to minimize dimensions while not losing data. 

Similarly, the best possible dimension to maximize data while not keeping too many dimensions is 87, but this is only for more specific work that 33 dimensions doesn't work for.
